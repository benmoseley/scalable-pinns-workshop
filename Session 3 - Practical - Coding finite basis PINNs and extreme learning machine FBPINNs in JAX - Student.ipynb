For **linear ODEs and PDEs**, this will allow us to turn their loss function into a **least-squares** problem which can be solved much more efficiently using **traditional numerical linear algebra techniques**, rather than gradient desent.\n","\n","### Extreme learning machine FBPINNs (aka ELM-FBPINNs)\n","\n","To linearise FBPINNs, we will use **[extreme learning machines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231206000385)** as the subdomain networks in the FBPINN.
